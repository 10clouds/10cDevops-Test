# Technical exercise	

We would like to challenge you with a technical exercise. It will check the level of your knowledge in common DevOps technologies that we’re using. You don’t have to do all of the exercises, but try to do as much as you can.

### 1. Github
All your changes should be made in a **private** fork of this repository. When you're done please, please:
* Create private repository on your Github account
* Give read only access to 10Clouds-devops-test user.

### 2. Application
* Prepare simple 3-tier hello-world application with flask or django where you can simply interact (read/write) with database.

### 3. Docker
* Dockerize application that you have been prepared
* Prepare Docker Compose files for local/dev/prod environments

### 4. Automation
* Prepare ci/cd flow in declarative pipeline (Jenkinsfile) 
* Use ansible to deploy all changes to server

### 5. Infrastructure
* Terraform → Prepare IaC setup on one of the selected public clouds (aws/gcp). Think’s about: VPC, EC2/ECS, S3, RDS, ELB etc.

### 6. Documentation
* Remember about writing simple, clean documentation of how to run your application.

### *7. Kubernetes
* Make sure that your containers can be deployed on Kubernetes Clusters. Minikube can be your new friend.

### 8. If you have any ideas and want to expand above tasks feel free to do so!
